OldSchool RuneScape Pet Listing Generation tool.

By querying https://templeosrs.com/ API the table will display your pets below.
Use the sidebar options to customize the chart's visual appearance.

More or less created for Streamers who hunt pets and do not have any artisic skill / anyone to create !pets commands for them. 

## Features

- Create a **highly customizable** Pet Listing for your OldSchool Runescape account
- View your dry streaks OR *how lucky you were*
- Import / Export your Kc's & Pets for ease of updating
- Manual mode rather than pulling your data from an API
- View your clans ranking leaderboard
